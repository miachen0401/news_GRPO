To find out how much the Legos set cost, we need to subtract the earnings from the three little cars from the total earnings. We also need to know how much one little car costs, which is given as $5.
There are three little cars, so their total cost is 3 cars * $5 per car = $15.
The total amount earned was $45, so the cost of the Legos set is $45 - $15 = $30.

Answer: The Legos set cost $30.

✓ GROUND TRUTH: First, we need to determine how many points Righty scored. To do this we perform 20/2=<<20/2=10>>10 points since Righty scored half as many as Lefty did.
Then, to find the other teammate's points we perform 10*6=<<10*6=60>>60 points scored, as they scored 6 times as many as Righty did.
We then add all three teammates' points together, performing 20+10+60=<<20+10+60=90>>90 points as the first step towards finding the average.
We then divide this sum by the total number of players we're averaging, getting 90/3=<<90/3=30>>30 points per player

First, we need to determine how many points Righty scores. Since Righty scores half as many points as Lefty, we calculate Righty's points by dividing Lefty's points by 2.
Next, we need to calculate their other teammate's points. Since their other teammate scores 6 times as much as Righty, we multiply Righty's points by 6.
Finally, we find the average points per player by adding all the points together and dividing by the number of players.

To find the average amount of beef sold per day, we first need to calculate the total amount of beef sold over the three days.
On Thursday, they sold 210 pounds.
On Friday, they sold twice that amount, so 210 x 2 = 420 pounds.
On Saturday, they sold 150 pounds.
Now, let's add up the total amount of beef sold: 210 + 420 + 150 = 780 pounds.
To find the average daily sales, we divide the total amount by the number of days, which is 3 days.
So, we have 780 pounds / 3 days = 260 pounds per da...

Lisa buys a phone for $1000.
The phone contract costs $200/month.
The case costs 20% of the phone's price, so it is $1000 * 0.20 = $200.
The headphones cost half as much as the case, which is $200 / 2 = $100.
The total monthly cost is the phone contract and the cost of the case and the headphones: $200 + $200 + $100 = $500.
In a year, there are 12 months, so the total yearly cost is $500/month * 12 months = $6000.

To determine the difference in carbon emissions before and after the introduction of the bus service, we can break down the problem as follows:

1. **Calculate the original carbon emissions**:
    - Original number of people who drove: 80
    - Total carbon emissions without the bus: 
        80 people * 10 pounds/carbon = 800 pounds

2. **Calculate the number of people now using the bus**:

First, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the woodburning. John sells each woodburning for $15 and sells 20 of them. So the total revenue is 20 * $15 = $300. 

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the wood. John spent $100 to buy the wood. 

Now we can find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue. So, profit = $300 - $100 = $200.

Therefore, the answer is $200.

So, we can write:
\[ \frac{T}{2} \text{ (raspberries)} + \frac{T}{3} \text{ (blackberries)} + \text{ (blueberries)} = T \]

Since the total number of berries is:
\[ T = 42 \]

<answer>
The total amount of beef sold over the three days is:
210 pounds (Thursday) + 2*(210 pounds) (Friday) + 150 pounds (Saturday) = 860 pounds

The number of days is 3.

So, the average amount of beef sold per day is:
860 pounds / 3 days = 286.67 pounds/day

First, let's find the cost of the case. The case costs 20% of the cost of the phone. So, the cost of the case is 0.2 * $1000 = $200.
Next, we find the cost of the headphones. The headphones cost half as much as the case. So, the cost of the headphones is $200 / 2 = $100.
Now, let's find the total monthly cost of the phone. This is the cost of the phone plus the cost of the case plus the cost of the headphones. So, the total monthly cost is $1000 + $200 + $100 = $1300.

First, we need to find the total amount of money the company has taken in. This is the sum of the individual bookings and the group bookings.

$12,000 (individual bookings) + $16,000 (group bookings) = $28,000

Next, we need to account for the $1600 that was returned due to cancellations.

$28,000 - $1600 = $26,400

Therefore, the sky diving company has taken altogether $26,400.

First, we need to calculate Luis's speed. He drives 80 miles in 2 hours.
Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 80 miles / 2 hours = 40 miles per hour
Now we need to calculate the distance he will cover in 15 minutes.
1 hour = 60 minutes
15 minutes = 15/60 = 1/4 hour
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 40 miles per hour x 1/4 hour = 10 miles.

First, calculate the total revenue from selling the woodburning. This is done by multiplying the number of woodburning sold by the price per piece:
20 * $15 = $300

Next, subtract the cost of the wood from the total revenue to find the profit. This is done by subtracting the cost of the wood from the total revenue:
$300 - $100 = $200

Therefore, the profit is $200.

Answer: $200

Let's solve this step by step.
Initially, there are 250 books in the library.
On Tuesday, 120 books are taken out, so we subtract 120 from 250.
250 - 120 = 130 books remaining in the library.
On Wednesday, 35 books are returned, so we add 35 to 130.
130 + 35 = 165 books in the library.
On Thursday, another 15 books are withdrawn, so we subtract 15 from 165.
165 - 15 = 150 books remaining in the library.

Each of Noah's closets can fit \( \frac{1}{4} \) as many jeans as Ali's closet, which can hold 200 pairs.

So, each of Noah's closets can fit \( \frac{1}{4} \times 200 = 50 \) pairs of jeans.

Since Noah has two closets, we multiply the number of jeans each closet can fit by 2.

\( 50 \times 2 = 100 \) pairs of jeans can fit in both of Noah's closets.

Sam won 50% of the first 100 matches. 
We need to calculate 50% of 100, which is 50 matches.
In his next 100 games, he won 60% of the matches.
To find out how many matches he won, we need to calculate 60% of 100, which is 60 matches.
To find the total number of matches he won, we add the number of matches he won in the first 100 games and the number of matches he won in the next 100 games.
50 + 60 = 110 matches

Let's break down the problem step by step.
First, let's denote the amount Porter made from selling his previous painting as \( x \).

From the problem, we know:
1. The amount sold the most recent painting for is $1000 less than five times more than he had made on his previous painting.
2. He received $44,000 for the sale of his most recent painting.

We can express this relationship using the equation:
\[ x + 1000 = 5x \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \).

Let's denote the cost of one pair of jeans as \( J \). The total cost of the items is given as $110. We know that the coat costs $40 and the shoes cost $30. The cost of the two pairs of jeans is then \( 2J \). We can set up the equation as follows:
\[ 40 + 30 + 2J = 110 \]
\[ 70 + 2J = 110 \]

Now we solve for \( J \):
\[ 2J = 110 - 70 \]
\[ 2J = 40 \]
\[ J = \frac{40}{2} \]
\[ J = 20 \]

So, one pair of jeans costs $20.

To solve this problem, we first find the average number of times Camden and Susannah swam each week.

Camden swam 16 times in March. Dividing this by 4 weeks, we have:
\[ \frac{16}{4} = 4 \]

Susannah swam 24 times in March, so dividing this by 4 weeks, we have:
\[ \frac{24}{4} = 6 \]

This means Camden swam 4 times a week, and Susannah swam 6 times a week.

To find out how many more times a week Susannah swam than Camden, we subtract Camden's number of swims from Susannah's:
\[ 6 - 4 = 2 \]

Mary bought two pairs of jeans for James, so the total cost for the jeans is \( 2J \). She also bought a coat for James for $40 and a pair of shoes for Jamie for $30. The total cost of the items was $110. Therefore, we can write the equation as:

\[ 2J + 40 + 30 = 110 \]

Combine the constants:

\[ 2J + 70 = 110 \]

Subtract 70 from both sides to isolate \( 2J \):

Let's denote the number of bluebirds as B.
According to the information given, there were twice as many cardinals as bluebirds, so the number of cardinals would be 2B.
There were half as many swallows as bluebirds, so the number of swallows would be B/2.
It's also given that there were 2 swallows, which means B = 2.
Now we can find the number of birds for each type, given B = 2:
- Number of bluebirds: B = 2
- Number of cardinals: 2B = 2 * 2 = 4
- Number of swallows: B/2 = 2/2 = 1

On Friday they sold twice the amount they sold on Thursday, so 210 * 2 = 420 pounds.
On Saturday they sold 150 pounds.
Now we add up the total amount sold: 210 + 420 + 150 = 780 pounds.

Let's solve this step by step.
1. First, find out how much Maya could lift when she started.
   America can lift 240 pounds.
   Maya can lift a fourth of that, so:
    Maya's initial lift = 240/4 = 60 pounds.
2. Now we know that Maya can lift 60 pounds when she starts.
3. Now, let's figure out how much Maya can lift at her peak. 
   Maya needs to lift half of what America can lift, which is 300 pounds.
4. Let's denote Maya's peak lift as \( M \).
   So, \( M = \frac{300}{2} \).

✓ GROUND TRUTH: The original price of the bag was reduced by $500 x 5/100 = $<<500*5/100=25>>25.
So its selling price after a week was $500 - $25 = $<<500-25=475>>475.
The price of the bag was again reduced by $475 x 4/100 = $<<475*4/100=19>>19.
So, its selling price now is $475 - $19 = $<<475-19=456>>456.
Therefore, the total reduction from the selling price is $500 - $456 = $<<500-456=44>>44.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the reduction in price first, and then find the total reduction from the original selling price.

1. Calculate the first reduction:
   - Original price: $500
   - Reduction: 5%
   - Reduction amount: $500 * (5/100) = $25
   
   Therefore, after the first reduction, the price is $500 - $25 = $475.

2. Calculate the second reduction:
   - New price after first reduction: $475
   - Reduction: 4%
   - Reduction amount: $475 * (4/100) = $19

Sam won 50% of his first 100 matches, which is 50% of 100. To calculate this, we use the formula: number of matches won = total matches * percentage won. So, the number of matches won in the first 100 matches is 100 * 0.5 = 50.

In his next 100 games, he won 60% of matches, which is 60% of 100. To calculate this, we use the same formula: number of matches won = total matches * percentage won. So, the number of matches won in the next 100 games is 100 * 0.6 = 60.

Step 1: Calculate the price reduction for the first week.
- The price reduction for the first week is 5% of the original price.
  Initial price: $500
  Reduction: 5% of $500
  $500 * 0.05 = $25

So, the price after the first week reduction is:
$500 - $25 = $475

Step 2: Calculate the price reduction for the second month.
- The price reduction for the second month is 4% of the new price after the first week's reduction.
  New price: $475
  Reduction: 4% of $475

So, we can write the equation:
2x + $40 + $30 = $110
Now, we can solve for x:
2x + $70 = $110

We will start by calculating the total number of boxes.
Group 1: 7 trucks with 20 boxes each, for 7*20 = 140 boxes.
Group 2: 5 trucks with 12 boxes each, for 5*12 = 60 boxes.
Total: 140 boxes + 60 boxes = 200 boxes.
Each box contains 8 containers of oil, so total oil: 200 boxes * 8 containers = 1600 containers.
We'll redistribute the oil onto 10 trucks, so each truck will have 1600 containers / 10 trucks = 160 containers of oil.

Let's calculate the distance each runner covers in 56 minutes.
For the first runner:
56 minutes / 8 minutes per mile = 7 miles

For the second runner:
56 minutes / 7 minutes per mile = 8 miles

After 56 minutes, the second runner has covered 8 miles and has stopped. The first runner can continue for a certain time before catching up with the second runner.

When the first runner starts, the second runner has already covered 8 miles, so the gap between them is 8 miles. The first runner runs...

✓ GROUND TRUTH: After 56 minutes, the second runner has traveled 56/7 = <<56/7=8>>8 miles.
Similarly, the first runner has traveled 56/8 = <<56/8=7>>7 miles.
Therefore, the two runners are 8 - 7 = <<8-7=1>>1 mile apart when the second runner stops.
Thus, the second runner can stop for a maximum of 8 minutes, which is the amount of time it takes the first runner to travel 1 mile.

First, we need to determine how far the second runner has run in 56 minutes. Since he runs at an average pace of 7 minutes per mile, we can set up an equation to find the distance he has covered.

The equation is:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 7 \, \text{minutes/mile} \times 56 \, \text{minutes} \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 392 \, \text{miles} \]

So, the second runner has covered 392 miles in 56 minutes.

Now, to find out how much Denver will charge for two birdhouses, we multiply the cost of one birdhouse by 2: $16 * 2 = $32.

Therefore, Denver will charge Danny $32 for buy...

The equation can be set up as:
\[ 40 + 2x + 30 = 110 \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):
\[ 70 + 2x = 110 \]
\[ 2x = 110 - 70 \]
\[ 2x = 40 \]
\[ x = \frac{40}{2} \]
\[ x = 20 \]

One pair of jeans costs $20.

Let's denote the number of bluebirds as \(B\).
According to the problem, swallows (\(S\)) are half as many as bluebirds, so \(S = \frac{1}{2}B\).
Also, there are three times more cardinals (\(C\)) than bluebirds, so \(C = 3B\).

Given that swallows \(S\) are 2, we can write:
\[ S = 2 \]

Substituting this into our equation for swallows, we get:
\[ 2 = \frac{1}{2}B \]

Solving for \(B\), we multiply both sides by 2:
\[ B \cdot 2 = 2 \]
\[ B = 1 \]

To find the combined total number of sit-ups performed, we need to calculate the number of sit-ups each person does separately and then add them up.

1. Barney: He can do 45 sit-ups per minute. In 1 minute, he will do 45 sit-ups.
2. Carrie: She can do twice as many sit-ups per minute as Barney, so she can do 2 * 45 = 90 sit-ups per minute. In 2 minutes, she will do 90 * 2 = 180 sit-ups.
3. Jerrie: She can do 5 more sit-ups per minute than Carrie, so she can do 90 + 5 = 95 sit-ups per min...

✓ GROUND TRUTH: Carrie can do 2*45=<<2*45=90>>90 sit-ups per minute.
Jerrie can do 90+5=<<90+5=95>>95 sit-ups per minute.
In two minutes, Carrie would perform 90*2-180 sit-ups.
And in three minutes, Jerrie would perform 3 * 95=<<3*95=285>>285 sit-ups.
Thus, in the scenario described, in total, the three would perform 45+180+285=<<45+180+285=510>>510 sit-ups.

In order to calculate how far Luis will go in 15 minutes, I need to find his speed first. The speed can be calculated as: speed = distance / time
Luis drove 80 miles in 2 hours, so his speed is: 80 miles / 2 hours = 40 miles per hour.
15 minutes is therefore 15/60 of an hour.
So in 15 minutes, Luis will drive: 40 miles per hour * 15/60 = 10 miles.

To solve this, we need to find Luis's speed in miles per hour, and then use that to find out how far he travels in 15 minutes.
Speed = distance/time
80 miles / 2 hours = 40 miles per hour
Now, we use the speed to find out how far Luis travels in 15 minutes:
15 minutes = 15/60 hours = 1/4 hours
Distance = speed * time
Distance = 40 miles per hour * 1/4 hours = 10 miles
Therefore, Luis will travel 10 miles in 15 minutes.

According to the problem, the sale price of the most recent painting is \( 5x - 1000 \).
We are given that the sale price is $44,000. Thus, we can set up the equation:
\[ 5x - 1000 = 44000 \]
To find \( x \), we first add 1000 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 5x = 45000 \]
Next, we divide both sides by 5:
\[ x = 9000 \]
So, Porter made $9,000 for selling his previous painting.

Let's break down the information given:
1. The most recent painting sold for $44,000.
2. This amount is $1000 less than five times more than he had made on his previous painting.

Let's denote the amount made from the previous painting as \( P \).

From the second piece of information, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 44000 = 5P - 1000 \]

Now, let's solve for \( P \).
</think>

To solve for \( P \), we first add 1000 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 44000 + 1000 = 5P \]

✓ GROUND TRUTH: The original price of the bag was reduced by $500 x 5/100 = $<<500*5/100=25>>25.
So its selling price after a week was $500 - $25 = $<<500-25=475>>475.
The price of the bag was again reduced by $475 x 4/100 = $<<475*4/100=19>>19.
So, its selling price now is $475 - $19 = $<<475-19=456>>456.
Therefore, the total reduction from the selling price is $500 - $456 = $<<500-456=44>>44.

The original price of the bag is $500.
A week after, the price was reduced by 5%.
Let's calculate the reduced price to find out how much the bag cost before the second reduction.

$500 - (5% of $500) = $500 - ($500 * 0.05) = $500 - $25 =$475.

Now, a month after, the price was reduced by another 4%.

$475 - (4% of $475) = $475 - ($475 * 0.04) = $475 - $19 = $456.

So, the final selling price after the second reduction is $456.

Let's break down the calculations step by step:

1. The original selling price is $500.
2. After a week, the price was reduced by 5%, so we calculate 5% of $500.
   5% of $500 = 0.05 * $500 = $25
3. Therefore, the new price after the first reduction is:
   $500 - $25 = $475
4. A month later, the bag was sold at $475. The price was reduced by 4% from this selling price.
5. Calculate 4% of $475.
   4% of $475 = 0.04 * $475 = $19

8 ounces x 4 = 32 ounces
5 ounces x 6 = 30 ounces
Total used = 32 + 30 = 62 ounces
122 ounces - 62 ounces = 60 ounces
Finally, we need to calculate how many 4-ounce glasses Claudia can fill.

<answer>
40 mph
</answer>

Now, we need to calculate how far Luis will travel in 15 minutes at his average speed of 40 mph. 

1. We know that 15 minutes is equal to 0.25 hours (since 1 hour = 60 minutes, 0.25 hours = 15 minutes).
2. Now, we multiply the distance he travels in 1 hour (80 miles) by the ratio of hours in 15 minutes to 1 hour:
   80 miles/1 hour * 0....

Denver wants to make a $5.50 profit per birdhouse. To find out how much he will charge for each birdhouse, we add his cost to his profit: $10.50 + $5.50 = $16.00.
Now, if Danny wants to buy two birdhouses, Denver will charge Danny: 2 * $16.00 = $32.00.

Therefore, Denver will charge Danny $32.00 for two birdhouses.

First, we need to figure out the total number of donuts Sophie bought. Since there are 12 donuts in each box and she bought 4 boxes, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of donuts per box.
Total donuts bought = 12 donuts/box * 4 boxes = 48 donuts

Next, we need to determine how many donuts Sophie gave away. She gave away 1 box of donuts which is 12 donuts, and half a dozen donuts. Since half a dozen is 6 donuts, the total donuts given away = 12 + 6 = 18 donuts.

Let's start by identifying the information given:
- There are 2 swallows.
- The number of swallows is half the number of bluebirds.
- The number of cardinals is three times the number of bluebirds.

First, we can determine the number of bluebirds:
Since swallows are half the number of bluebirds:
\[ \text{Number of bluebirds} = 2 \times 2 = 4 \]

Next, we find the number of cardinals:
\[ \text{Number of cardinals} = 4 \times 3 = 12 \]

Now, we add up all the birds to get the total number ...

First, let's find out how many sit-ups each person can do per minute.
Barney can do 45 sit-ups per minute.
Carrie can do twice as many as Barney, which is 45 * 2 = 90 sit-ups per minute.
Jerrie can do 5 more sit-ups per minute than Carrie, which is 90 + 5 = 95 sit-ups per minute.
Now let's calculate the total number of sit-ups each person does.
Barney performs sit-ups for 1 minute, so he does 45 sit-ups.

To find out how far Luis will go in 15 minutes, we first need to determine his speed in miles per hour. We can use the formula: speed = distance / time.

Speed = 80 miles / 2 hours = 40 miles per hour.
Now, since 15 minutes is 1/4 of an hour, we can calculate the distance he will travel in that time.
Distance = speed * time = 40 miles/hour * 15/60 hours = 10 miles.

First, let's calculate the revenue from last month's sales.
For large paintings: 8 large paintings * $60 per painting = $480
For small paintings: 4 small paintings * $30 per painting = $120
Total revenue for last month = $480 + $120 = $600

Now, let's calculate the number of paintings sold this month.
Twice as much as last month: 2 * 8 large paintings + 2 * 4 small paintings = 16 large paintings + 8 small paintings = 24 paintings

Let's break down the information given:
1. The sale price of the most recent painting was $44,000.
2. The sale price was $1000 less than five times more than what he made on his previous painting.

Let \( x \) be the amount he made on his previous painting.
The equation based on the information is:
\[ 44,000 = 5x - 1000 \]

To find the value of \( x \), we add 1000 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 44,000 + 1000 = 5x \]
\[ 45,000 = 5x \]

Next, we divide both sides by 5 to solve for \( x...

The price of the bag was again reduced by $475 x 4/100 = $<<475*4/100=19>>19.

First we need to find out how much money James has after saving for four weeks. We do this by multiplying $10 by 4, because he earns $10 per week and saves it up for four weeks.
$10 x 4 = $40
Now we need to determine how much money James spends on the video game. We do this by finding half of his total savings. We do this by dividing $40 by 2.
$40 / 2 = $20
Now we know James has $20 remaining after buying the video game. We then need to find out how much money he spends on the book. We do ...

First, we calculate the total number of boxes in the 7 trucks with 20 boxes each and the 5 trucks with 12 boxes each.
Total boxes = (7 trucks * 20 boxes/truck) + (5 trucks * 12 boxes/truck)
Then, we find out how many containers of oil are there in total.
Total containers = Total boxes * 8 containers/box
Finally, we distribute all the oil onto 10 trucks.
Number of containers per truck = Total containers / 10 trucks

As Maya grows stronger, she adds 10 pounds each time she reaches her peak:

America reaches her peak at 300 pounds.

If Maya reaches her absolute peak and can lift half of what America can lift, she can:

So its selling price after a week was $500 - $25 = $<<500-25=475>>475.
The price of the bag was again reduced by $475 x 4/100 = $<<475*4/100=19>>19.
So, its selling price now is $475 - $19 = $<<475-19=456>>456.
Therefore, the total reduction from the selling price is $500 - $456 = $<<500-456=44>>44.

   $500 * 0.05 = $25 for the first reduction.
2. Subtract the first reduction from the original price: $500 - $25 = $475.
3. Calculate the second reduction from the new price:
   $475 * 0.04 = $19.
4. Subtract the second reduction from the new price to get the final selling price: $475 - $19 = $456.

   100 matches * 50% = 100 * 0.5 = 50 matches won

2. Next, we calculate the number of matches Sam won in his next 100 games. Since he won 60% of these matches:

First, we need to calculate the cost of the case and the headphones.
The case costs 20% of the phone's cost.
$200/month * .20 = $40/month for the case.
The headphones cost half as much as the case.
$40/month * .50 = $20/month for the headphones.
Now we need to add up all of the monthly costs.
$200/month + $40/month + $20/month = $260/month.
To find the total cost of the phone in the first year, we need to multiply the monthly cost by 12.
$260/month * 12 months = $3,120.

Let's denote the price of one pair of jeans as \( J \).

Mary bought her son James a coat for $40 and two pairs of jeans. So, the cost for the jeans is \( 2J \).

She also bought her sister Jamie a pair of shoes for $30.

The total cost of all the items amounted to $110. Therefore, the equation representing the total cost is:
\[ 40 + 2J + 30 = 110 \]

Now, we solve the equation to find the price of one pair of jeans.

Let's denote the cost of one pair of jeans as \( J \).

Mary bought two pairs of jeans for her son James and one pair of shoes for his sister Jamie, with a total of $110.

The cost equation can be set up as follows:
\[ 40 + 2J + 30 = 110 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ 70 + 2J = 110 \]

Subtract 70 from both sides to isolate \( 2J \):
\[ 2J = 40 \]

Now, divide by 2 to solve for \( J \):
\[ J = 20 \]

So, one pair of jeans cost $20.

Next, find out how much meat James has in total by adding up the beef and pork he bought. That's 20 pounds (beef) + 10 pounds (pork) = 30 pounds.
Then, determine how many meals he can make by dividing the total pounds of meat by the pounds per meal. That's 30 pounds / 1.5 pounds per meal = 20 meals.

To find out how far Luis will go in 15 minutes, we first need to calculate his speed. We know that he drives 80 miles in 2 hours.

Speed is calculated with the formula: speed = distance / time

speed = 80 miles / 2 hours = 40 miles per hour

Now that we know his speed is 40 miles per hour, we can calculate how far he will go in 15 minutes.

15 minutes is 1/4 of an hour.

The stand sells 10 hot dogs per hour.
Each hot dog sells for $2.
Total sales per hour is 10 hot dogs * $2 per hot dog = $20.
We want to make $200 in sales.
To find out how many hours are needed, we divide the total sales by the sales per hour: $200 / $20 per hour = 10 hours.

Let's start by calculating the revenue generated per hour from selling hot dogs.
Revenue per hour = Hot dogs sold per hour * Price per hot dog
                 = 10 * $2
                 = $20

Now, we need to determine the number of hours required to reach the target sales of $200.
Hours required = Target sales / Revenue per hour
              = $200 / $20
              = 10

Therefore, the hot dog stand requires to run for 10 hours to make $200 in sales.

Next, we need to find out how much profit John makes. Profit is calculated by subtracting the cost of the wood from the total revenue. Profit = Total revenue - Cost of wood = $300 - $100 = $200.

Now, let's write the final answer.

To find the total cost, we need to first determine the cost of a kilogram of chicken and then calculate the total cost for 3 kilograms of chicken and 1 kilogram of pork.
Chicken costs $2 less than pork, so a kilogram of chicken costs $6 - $2 = $4.

Next, we calculate the cost for 3 kilograms of chicken: 3 kg × $4/kg = $12.

Then, we add the cost of 1 kilogram of pork: $12 + $6 = $18.

Therefore, a 3-kilogram of chicken and a kilogram of pork will cost $18.

\[ 40 + 2J + 30 = 110 \]

Now, let's solve for \( J \).

\[ 2J = 40 \]
\[ J = \frac{40}{2} \]

First, let's calculate how many jeans each of Noah's closets can fit.
Ali's closet can fit 200 pairs of jeans.
Each of Noah's closets can fit 1/4 of that, which is 200/4.
So, each of Noah's closets can fit 50 pairs of jeans.

Now that we know each of Noah's closets can fit 50 pairs of jeans, let's calculate how many pairs of jeans both closets can fit.
There are two closets, and each can fit 50 pairs, so we need to multiply 50 by 2.
50 x 2 = 100 pairs of jeans.

To find the average amount of beef sold per day, we first need to calculate the total amount sold over the three days.

On Thursday, Walmart sold 210 pounds of ground beef.
On Friday, they sold twice that amount, so 210 x 2 = 420 pounds.
On Saturday, they sold 150 pounds.

Now, let's add up the total amount sold over the three days:
210 + 420 + 150 = 780 pounds

Now, we need to divide the total amount by the number of days to find the average:
780 ÷ 3 = 260 pounds per day

Luis drives 80 miles in 2 hours, so his rate is 80 miles / 2 hours = 40 miles/hour.

Next, we need to find out how far he travels in 15 minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 15 minutes is 15/60 = 1/4 of an hour.

Now we can calculate the distance Luis travels in 15 minutes. Distance = rate × time = 40 miles/hour × 1/4 hour = 10 miles.

Speed = 80 miles / 2 hours = 40 mph

Now, we need to convert 15 minutes to hours because Luis's speed is given in miles per hour.
15 minutes = 15/60 hours = 0.25 hours

Now, we can calculate the distance Luis will travel in 15 minutes.
Distance = Speed * Time

Distance = 40 mph * 0.25 hours = 10 miles

First, we need to calculate Noah's sales last month. He sold 8 large paintings and 4 small paintings. The price for a large painting is $60 and for a small painting is $30.

1. Calculate the total revenue from large paintings:
8 large paintings * $60/large painting = $480

2. Calculate the total revenue from small paintings:
4 small paintings * $30/small painting = $120

3. Sum up the total revenue for last month:
$480 (from large paintings) + $120 (from small paintings) = $600

Let's denote the amount Porter made from his previous painting as \( P \).

We know that the most recent painting sold for $44,000, which is $1000 less than five times more than he made on his previous painting. This can be mathematically represented as:

\[ \text{Price of most recent painting} = 5P - 1000 \]

Given that the price of the most recent painting is $44,000, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 44000 = 5P - 1000 \]

To solve for \( P \), we first add 1000 to both sides o...

Kenny charges $15 per lawn and has mowed 35 lawns, so his total income is $15 * 35 = $525.
The video-games cost $45 each, so he can buy 5 video-games for $45 * 5 = $225.
Now he has $525 - $225 = $300 left to spend on books.
Books cost $5 each, so he can buy 300 / 5 = 60 books.

$12,000 + $16,000 = $28,000
Next, subtract the amount that has to be returned: 
$28,000 - $1,600 = $26,400
Therefore, the sky diving company has taken altogether $26,400.
Answer: $26,400

Let's denote the cost of one pair of jeans as \( x \).

Mary bought:
- A coat for $40.
- Two pairs of jeans for \( 2x \).
- A pair of shoes for $30.

The total cost was $110. So, we can write the equation as:
\[ 40 + 2x + 30 = 110 \]

now, solve for \( x \)
\[ 40 + 30 + 2x = 110 \]
\[ 70 + 2x = 110 \]
\[ 2x = 110 - 70 \]
\[ 2x = 40 \]
\[ x = \frac{40}{2} \]
\[ x = 20 \]

Therefore, one pair of jeans costs $20.

Let's break down the problem step by step.
1. James earns $10 per week and saves it for four weeks.
2. To find out how much James saved, we multiply his weekly allowance by the number of weeks he saved for: $10 * 4 weeks = $40.
3. James spends half of his saved money on a new video game. So, we need to calculate half of $40: $40 / 2 = $20.
4. Now, James spends a quarter of the remaining money on a new book. To find this amount, we calculate a quarter of the remaining savings after buying...

First, let's calculate the total time Polly spends cooking breakfast each day during the week. Since she spends 20 minutes cooking breakfast every day, we multiply this by the number of days in a week for breakfast, which is 7 days.

Polly spends 20 minutes x 7 = 140 minutes cooking breakfast in a week.

Next, let's calculate the time she spends cooking dinner. We add up the time she spends cooking dinner on the days she cooks it for 4 days and the days she cooks it for 30 minutes.

To find out how many minutes Polly spends cooking this week, we need to calculate the total time spent on each type of meal and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the time spent on breakfast:
Polly spends 20 minutes cooking breakfast every day. There are 7 days in a week, so:
20 minutes/day * 7 days = 140 minutes

Next, let's calculate the time spent on lunch:
Polly spends 5 minutes cooking lunch every day. There is only 1 day this week where she cooks lunch, so:
