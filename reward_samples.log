Next, we know that a piece of bread has 100 calories. So, if Toby has one piece of bread, he will consume 100 calories from the bread.

To find out how many calories are left for the peanut butter, we subtract the calories from the bread from the total calories Toby wants:
500 calories (total) - 100 calories (bread) = 400 calories

First, we need to determine how many tulips Elrond picked. Since Elrond picked twice as many tulips as Arwen, we can calculate this by multiplying the number of tulips Arwen picked by 2.
Arwen picked 20 tulips, so Elrond picked 20 * 2 = 40 tulips.
Now, to find the total number of tulips they picked, we add the number of tulips Arwen picked to the number of tulips Elrond picked.
20 (Arwen's tulips) + 40 (Elrond's tulips) = 60 tulips in total.
Therefore, the answer is 60.

Josh starts with $300 in his wallet and $2000 invested in a business.
The business's stock price rises by 30%, so the increase in value is 30% of $2000.
30% of $2000 is calculated as 0.30 * $2000 = $600.
So, the total value of the stocks after the increase is $2000 + $600 = $2600.
Now, Josh sells all of his stocks, so he will receive $2600 from the sale.
Adding this to the money he already has in his wallet, Josh will have $300 + $2600 = $2900 in his wallet.

First, we need to determine how many customers Tom served in total. We do this by multiplying the number of customers he served per hour by the number of hours he worked. So, 10 customers/hour * 8 hours = 80 customers.
Next, we need to calculate 20% of the total number of customers served. We do this by multiplying the total number of customers by 20% (or 0.20). So, 80 customers * 0.20 = 16 bonus points.
Therefore, Tom earned 16 bonus points that day.

First, let's calculate how much John used to spend on coffee per day. He used to buy 4 coffees a day at $2 each, so:
4 coffees * $2 per coffee = $8 per day

Next, let's calculate the new price per coffee after the 50% increase. A 50% increase on $2 is:
50% of $2 = 0.5 * $2 = $1
So, the new price per coffee is:
$2 + $1 = $3 per coffee

Now, let's calculate how many coffees John drinks now. He cut the number of coffees he drinks in half, so:
4 coffees / 2 = 2 coffees per day

First, calculate the distance driven at 30 mph for 0. 5 hours.
Distance = Speed * Time

Distance driven at 30 mph: 30 mph * 0. 5 hours = 15 miles

Next, James drives twice as long (1 hour) at twice the speed (60 mph).

Distance driven at 60 mph: 60 mph * 1 hour = 60 miles

Finally, add the two distances to get the total distance driven.

Total distance: 15 miles + 60 miles = 75 miles

Answer: 75 miles

To find the cost per piece of pizza, we need to divide the total cost by the total number of pieces. First, let's calculate the total number of pieces. We know that each pizza is cut into 5 pieces, and Luigi bought 4 pizzas. So the total number of pieces is:
4 pizzas * 5 pieces per pizza = 20 pieces

Next, we divide the total cost by the total number of pieces to find the cost per piece:
$80 / 20 pieces = $4 per piece

Therefore, each piece of pizza costs $4.

Jerome ate twice that amount, so Jerome ate 2 * 10 = 20 pizza rolls.
Tyler ate one and a half times more, so Tyler ate 1 * 1.5 = 1.5 times more than Jerome. Therefore, Tyler ate 1.5 * 20 = 30 pizza rolls.
Now we find out how many more pizza rolls Tyler ate than Jackson. Tyler ate 30 - 10 = 20 more pizza rolls than Jackson.

Step 1: Let's denote Leila's original savings as \( S \).
Step 2: Leila spent \( \frac{3}{4} \) of her savings on make-up. This means she spent \( \frac{3}{4}S \) on make-up.
Step 3: The rest of her savings, which is \( \frac{1}{4}S \), was spent on a sweater.
Step 4: We know that the sweater cost her $20. Therefore, \( \frac{1}{4}S = $20 \).
Step 5: To find \( S \), we need to solve the equation \( \frac{1}{4}S = $20 \).

Arman's current age = 6 * Sister's current age
Arman's current age = 6 * 6 = 36 years old.

Now, to find out in how many years Arman's age will be 40, we subtract his current age from 40:

40 - Arman's current age = 40 - 36 = 4 years.

Therefore, in 4 ...

1. First, we need to determine the number of rooms that have three beds. Since there are 13 rooms in total and 8 of them have two beds, the rest must have three beds. We can find the number of rooms with three beds by subtracting the number of rooms with two beds from the total number of rooms.
   13 total rooms - 8 rooms with two beds = 5 rooms with three beds.

500 pounds * 0.20 = 100 pounds reduced

Now we subtract that from the original weight.
500 pounds - 100 pounds = 400 pounds

John then triples that weight after training.

After one year, he has $1000 + $100 = $1100.
If it goes on for three years, he gets 3 * $100 = $300 interest.

Let's calculate the cost of each item:

1. One salad costs $3.
2. One kilogram of beef is two times more expensive than one salad, so:
   Cost of beef = 2 * ($3) = $6
3. One kilogram of potatoes costs one-third of the price of one salad, so:
   Cost of potatoes = ($3) / 3 = $1
4. One liter of juice is $1.5.

Now let's calculate the total cost:

Salads: 2 * $3 = $6
Beef: $6
Potatoes: $1
Juice: 2 * $1.5 = $3

Total cost = Salads + Beef + Potatoes + Juice = $6 + $6 + $1 + $3 = $16

First, we need to determine how many visitors fell ill.
20% of 500 visitors fell ill because 100% - 40% = 60%
Next, we need to subtract the number of visitors who fell ill from the total number of visitors to find out how many did not.
500 visitors \* 0.6 = 300
500 - 300 = 200
Therefore, 200 visitors did not fall ill.

Alice exchanges 20 quarters for nickels. 1 quarter = 5 nickels
20 quarters = 20 x 5 = 100 nickels
20% of 100 = 0.2 x 100 = 20 of the nickels are iron nickels
So the value of the 20 iron nickels = 20 x $3 = $60
Remaining 80 x $0.05 = $4
So the total value of her money now is $60 + $4 = $64

Tom swims for 2 hours at a speed of 2 miles per hour.
To find the distance he swims, we can use the formula: distance = speed × time.

Distance traveled by swimming: 
\(2 \text{ m/h} \times 2 \text{ h} = 4 \text{ miles}\)

He then runs for half the time he swims, which is \(2 \text{ h} / 2 = 1 \text{ hour}\). His speed is 4 times faster than his swimming speed of 2 m/h, so his running speed is \(4 \times 2 \text{ m/h} = 8 \text{ m/h}\).

First, we need to add up Hillary's reading time for Friday and Saturday to find out how much time she has already spent reading.
After Friday and Saturday, Hillary has 1 hour left to read. We need to convert 1 hour to minutes to make the math easier. There are 60 minutes in an hour.
16 min (Friday) + 28 min (Saturday) + X min (Sunday) = 60 min
34 + X = 60
X = 60 - 34
X = 26
Hillary needs to read 26 minutes on Sunday to complete her assignment.

First, let's calculate the initial quantities of each type of cookie:
- Oatmeal raisin: 3 dozen = 3 * 12 = 36 cookies
- Sugar: 2 dozen = 2 * 12 = 24 cookies
- Chocolate chip: 4 dozen = 4 * 12 = 48 cookies

Next, we'll subtract the number of cookies given away:
- Oatmeal raisin: 2 dozen = 2 * 12 = 24 cookies
- Sugar: 1.5 dozen = 1.5 * 12 = 18 cookies
- Chocolate chip: 2.5 dozen = 2.5 * 12 = 30 cookies

Now we can calculate how many cookies Ann keeps of each type:
- Oatmeal raisin: 3 dozen...

The total budget is $32 million.
Half of the budget goes towards policing, so we need to calculate that portion first.
32 million / 2 = 16 million for policing.
We know that $12 million goes towards education.
To find out how much is left for managing public spaces, we subtract the amount for policing and education from the total budget.
16 million + 12 million = $28 million
16 million + 12 million = 28 million

He also finds 3 full decks of cards, which means there are 3 * 52 = 156 cards.
So, in total, John has 78 + 156 = 234 cards.

However, he realizes that the quality of a lot of the cards is quite poor and decides to throw 34 of the cards in the trash.

Therefore, 234 - 34 = 200 cards remain.

1. John initially finds 3 half-finished decks of cards.
2. Each half-finished deck contains 26 cards (since each deck should hold 52 cards). Therefore, 3 half-finished decks contain 3 * 26 = 78 cards.
3. He also finds 3 full decks. Each full deck contains 52 cards. Therefore, 3 full decks contain 3 * 52 = 156 cards.
4. Now, let's add these two quantities together: 78 + 156 = 234 cards.
5. John realizes the quality of the cards is poor and decides to thr...

Facebook's total bonus amount is 25%, or 1/4, of its annual earnings. 
That means, Facebook will give a bonus of 5,000,000 * 0.25.
Facebook has 3,300 employees. One-third of them are men, which means there are 3,300 * 1/3 of them.
So, Facebook has 3,300 employees – 1,100 men = 2,200 women employees.
Out of these women, 1200 are not mothers, which means there are 2,200 – 1,200 = 1,000 female mother employees.
Each female mother employee will receive an equal $X bonus amount.
So, the bonus...

To solve this, we first need to calculate the discounted price of the $300 lens with the 20% discount.
1. Find the discount amount on the $300 lens:
$300 - ($300 * 20%) = $300 - ($300 * 0.20) = $300 - $60 = $240

2. Subtract the discount from the original price of the lens:
$300 - $240 = $60

Now we know the discounted price of the lens is $60.

3. Compare this discounted price to the price of the cheaper lens which is $220.
